// Signal identifier: what is this carrier? From a stretch of complex samples it measures the centre, the -3 / -20 / -26 dB and 99 % widths
// (specx::measure on its own spectrum), continuous or bursty (duty, burst length, the spacing of the burst starts), the modulation class (AM, FM,
// constant envelope, 2- or 4-level FSK, GMSK, BPSK / QPSK / pi/4-DQPSK / 8PSK from the |x|^n lines, QAM, OFDM from the flat top and the cyclic
// prefix correlation, LoRa chirps, pulses), the symbol rate (cyclostationary line of |x|^2, of the FM discriminator or of x^n) and, for FSK, the
// deviation levels. Then it scores the table of OnAir's modes (sig_known.cpp: what each one looks like) against the measurement, looks for the frame
// sync of the land-mobile systems and POCSAG / AIS where that is cheap, lets the frequency database and the band plan move the scores a little,
// and turns the scores into calibrated probabilities with a reject option ("unknown"). identify() is a pure function; Capture collects samples from
// the engine's sample path and runs it on its own thread (docs/signal-id.md says how it works, what the numbers mean and how well it does).
