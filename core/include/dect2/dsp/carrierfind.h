// Carrier finder and channelizer for "decode the whole visible span": from the power spectrum of the captured span, find the carriers that sit
// on a channel raster (12.5 kHz, 25 kHz, 6.25 kHz or any step), keep each one tracked while it talks and for a holding time after it goes quiet,
// and bring each one down to a baseband stream at the rate a single-channel decoder wants. Nothing here knows a protocol.
//
//   span samples -> windowed FFT, averaged -> power in each raster cell -> noise floor (low percentile of the cells) -> threshold with
//   hysteresis (on above noise + onDb, stays above noise + offDb) and a debounce -> tracked carriers (at most maxCarriers: the active and
//   the strongest first, a newcomer must beat a tracked one by 6 dB to push it out) -> Channelizer (mixer + resampler) per carrier.
//
// Frequencies are in Hz relative to the centre of the span (0 = the middle of the samples). The raster is gridOriginHz + k * stepHz.
