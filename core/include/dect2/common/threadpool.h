//   ThreadPool::shared()   one pool for the whole process, created on first use, N = hardware_concurrency - 1 (1..8) workers, named "onair-wN"
//   parallelFor(n, fn)     runs fn(0..n-1) on the pool; the calling thread helps and returns when all n are done (safe from inside a pool task)
//   submit(fn) -> future   runs fn on a worker
//
// DECT2_THREADS in the environment: unset = automatic, a number = that many workers, 0 = no workers at all: parallelFor and submit run
// on the calling thread in index order (debugging, determinism checks). Every user of the pool must give the same output for any N:
// jobs write only their own slot, results are merged in index order by the caller.
