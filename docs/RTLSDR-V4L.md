# RTL-SDR Blog V4 Lite (V4L)

Public facts (rtl-sdr.com launch post and users guide, 2026): USB manufacturer `RTLSDRBlog`, product `Blog V4L` (do not change them; the
drivers use them to identify the dongle). R828S tuner (one RF input fewer than the V4's R828D), diplexed input instead of the V4's
triplexer, **no notch filters**, same built-in HF upconverter (28.8 MHz LO) as the V4, 1 ppm TCXO, software-switched 4.5 V bias tee (up to
180 mA). No direct sampling is needed (it gives nothing). It needs the RTL-SDR Blog librtlsdr (V1.4.0 DLL or newer); older libraries give no
signal.

What OnAir does: lists it as "RTL-SDR Blog V4 Lite", treats it like a V4 (HF from 0.5 MHz through the library's upconverter, direct sampling
never asked for), normal RTL-SDR sample rates and gain table, bias tee through `rtlsdr_set_bias_tee`. No notch controls are shown.
Tested with the stub driver only, not with a real V4L.

Not public, so not assumed. A V4L owner please sends: the tuner id the library reports (`rtl_test -t` output), the descriptors
(`lsusb -v -d 0bda:2838`), the EEPROM (`rtl_eeprom -d 0`), whether HF below 28.8 MHz and the bias tee work in OnAir (log lines
"RTL-SDR: ... model V4"), and the highest sample rate without lost samples (`rtl_test -s 2.4e6`).
