# OnAir documentation index

The user guides and notes that live in the repository. The same text is on the [wiki](https://github.com/adswill/OnAir/wiki) and at [on-air.dev/docs](https://on-air.dev/docs/). The main README is [../README.md](../README.md); radios are in [../DEVICES.md](../DEVICES.md); the code layout is in [../ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md).
