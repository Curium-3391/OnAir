# Inmarsat (all carriers)

Status: new in 3.3, **needs a user test with a real capture**. Everything below was checked on synthetic signals only.

One mode that finds and decodes every Inmarsat L-band carrier of a wide capture at the same time. It sits beside the single-channel modes **Inmarsat Aero** and **Inmarsat-C**, which stay as they are.

## Use it

1. Pick **Inmarsat (all carriers)**, tune to the middle of your satellite's L-band channels (about 1545.6 MHz) and use a sample rate of **6 Msps or more** if your radio does it. An L-band antenna (patch or helix, with an LNA) is needed.
2. Press nothing: the search runs by itself (**Auto**; the Auto button forgets the carriers and searches again).
3. **Carriers** shows the whole capture as a strip and a table: frequency, type, bit rate, level, Eb/N0, state, last activity, ocean region for Inmarsat-C. Click a row to focus it (a focused carrier is never parked).
4. **Messages** lists ACARS and ADS-C from all P channels and Inmarsat-C EGC broadcasts, with a filter. **Aircraft** shows the aircraft with a position report on a map (reports come every few minutes). **Voice** is described below.

## What radios do

| Radio | Sample rate | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| RTL-SDR | 2.4 Msps | about 2 MHz: one P group or a few carriers |
| Airspy, SDRplay | 6 to 10 Msps | both P groups and neighbouring carriers |
| HackRF, HackRF Pro | 10 to 20 Msps | most of one satellite's downlink |

The 34 MHz downlink (1525 to 1559 MHz) never fits in one capture. Retune to see another part.

## What is decoded

- **Aero P channels** at 600, 1200 and 10500 bit/s (ACARS, ADS-C, log-ons, positions): all carriers at once, one window of about 160 kHz per group of carriers, cut from the capture with a single shared FFT.
- **Inmarsat-C** (EGC safety and news broadcasts) on the 2 kHz channels, with the ocean region and station from the bulletin board.
- A **CPU budget** (Advanced) limits the windows. Carriers that do not fit are listed as *parked: CPU*.

## What is not decoded

- **Aero C channels (voice).** They are listed ("may be a voice (C) channel") but cannot be demodulated yet: the C-channel modulation and framing are not in a public specification OnAir may reproduce. The voice mixer (per-carrier mute and solo), the call recorder and the codec hook are built and tested with test frames, but nothing feeds them from the air. This needs a user test with a real C-channel capture.
- **R and T channels** are aircraft-to-satellite signals on 1626.5 to 1660.5 MHz. A ground receiver sees them only from nearby aircraft; they are not decoded.
- **Voice codec.** Aero voice uses an AMBE-family codec. The codec is never shipped: OnAir never includes, downloads or links it: you build or install the plug-in yourself (`onair-codec-ambe`, see [CODECS.md](CODECS.md)). Until then the voice stays silent; calls are counted and their coded frames are saved. Only unencrypted traffic is ever played.

## How it relates to other tools

JAERO decodes one Aero channel at a time. InmarScope shows and decodes several channels. OnAir finds the carriers itself, decodes all of them in parallel and puts messages and aircraft from every channel in one place. Details and open questions: [INMARSAT-REVAMP.md](INMARSAT-REVAMP.md).
